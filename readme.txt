Directions on how to run program:
	1. Import project into Andriod Studio
	2. Create Emulator for Pixel 2, using Oreo 8.0
	3. Run on Emulator

Color Scheme:
	I went for a Navy Blue, Dark yellow scheme for the app. Blue and white 
	give it a more professional feeling, and the Dark yellow with the text
	the same color as the background is pleasing to my eye at least. As for
	finding these colors, I choose the navy color first and Android Studio
	suggested the color yellow in its palette.
